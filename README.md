Made with [Astro](https://astro.build/). Hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

Fun history about the website. It used to be regular HTML, JS & CSS with no framework. Then an attempt was made to use
[Angular](https://angularjs.org/) for the website to make things simpiler for me. I gave up and switched to
[Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) which is what was used before I made the final change to [Astro](https://astro.build/).
